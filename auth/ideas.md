Excellent! Given your enhanced system design, here are some feature suggestions to further strengthen your authentication service, improve user experience, and provide more value to your "other app."

### Feature Suggestions for Your Enhanced Authentication System

Building upon your new design with server-side sessions and multi-account type support, consider adding the following capabilities:

#### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA)

* **Description:** Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if a password is stolen.
* **Implementation Ideas:**
    * **Authenticator App (TOTP):** Allow users to link their account with apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. This involves generating a secret key (stored securely per user in your `users` table, encrypted), displaying a QR code, and verifying time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) during login.
    * **Email/SMS One-Time Passcodes (OTP):** Send a temporary code to the user's registered email or phone number (if you collect it) during login for verification.
    * **Recovery Codes:** Provide a set of single-use recovery codes that users can print or save, allowing access if they lose their primary MFA device.
* **Integration:**
    * Add a new `mfa_secret` (encrypted), `mfa_enabled` (`BOOLEAN`), and `mfa_recovery_codes` (encrypted) columns to your `users` table.
    * Develop API endpoints on your `auth` app for enabling/disabling MFA, generating recovery codes, and verifying TOTP codes.
    * Modify your login flow to prompt for MFA after successful primary authentication (email/password or Google).

#### 2. Comprehensive Password Management

* **Description:** Beyond just changing passwords, offer a full suite of secure password recovery and management tools.
* **Implementation Ideas:**
    * **"Forgot Password" Flow:**
        * User requests password reset by providing their email.
        * Your `auth` app sends a unique, time-limited, single-use token (UUID) via email to the user.
        * This token is stored in a temporary `password_reset_tokens` table with an expiration timestamp and linked to the `user_uuid`.
        * The user clicks a link in the email pointing to a password reset page on your "other app" (or a dedicated static page served by your auth app for this purpose), passing the token.
        * The frontend sends the new password and the token to your backend.
        * Your backend validates the token (exists, active, not expired, linked to correct user), hashes the new password, updates the `passwordHash` in the `users` table, invalidates the token in the `password_reset_tokens` table, and invalidates all existing sessions for that user (`sessions.is_active = FALSE`).
    * **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:** Implement server-side validation for password complexity (minimum length, requiring mixed characters, disallowing common passwords).
    * **Password History/Reuse Prevention:** Store a history of past password hashes for each user (e.g., last 3-5 passwords) to prevent reuse.
* **Integration:**
    * New `password_reset_tokens` table (`token_id`, `user_uuid`, `created_at`, `expires_at`, `is_used`).
    * New API endpoints: `POST /forgot-password`, `POST /reset-password`.
    * Enhancements to `users` table for password history.

#### 3. Account Deletion

* **Description:** Provide users with a secure and clear way to delete their account and associated data.
* **Implementation Ideas:**
    * **Confirmation with Re-authentication:** Require the user to re-enter their password or perform a fresh Google login to confirm the deletion request.
    * **Consequences Disclosure:** Clearly inform the user about what data will be lost and the irreversibility of the action.
    * **Soft Delete vs. Hard Delete:**
        * **Soft Delete:** Set an `is_deleted` flag in the `users` table, invalidate all sessions, and restrict further login attempts. This allows for data recovery or compliance needs without full deletion.
        * **Hard Delete:** Physically remove the user's data from the `users` table and any linked data.
    * **Data Minimization:** Ensure all personal data is deleted or anonymized in compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
* **Integration:**
    * New `is_deleted` (`BOOLEAN`) column in `users` table, or a `deleted_at` (`BIGINT`) timestamp.
    * API endpoint: `POST /account-delete`.
    * Modify `UserDao` to handle soft/hard deletion and ensure deleted users cannot log in.

#### 4. Expanded Social Logins

* **Description:** Offer additional social login options beyond Google (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, GitHub, LinkedIn).
* **Implementation Ideas:**
    * Each new social provider requires its own OAuth 2.0 client ID and secret setup.
    * The `oauth2callback` servlet logic would need to be generalized or extended to handle multiple providers (e.g., by having `google-oauth2callback`, `facebook-oauth2callback` or a unified `oauth2callback` that takes a `provider` parameter).
    * You'd add new columns to your `users` table for each provider's unique ID (e.g., `facebook_id`, `apple_id`), similar to `google_id`.
    * The `acc_type` `ENUM` might expand (e.g., `facebook`, `apple`, `email_facebook`, etc.) or you might rely solely on the presence of the respective `_id` columns.
* **Benefit:** Increased convenience for users, broader reach for your "other app."

#### 5. Centralized Security Logging and Monitoring

* **Description:** Implement robust logging for all authentication-related events, making it easier to detect and respond to security incidents.
* **Implementation Ideas:**
    * **Log all key events:** Successful logins, failed login attempts (with reason, e.g., bad password, MFA failure), password changes, account creations, account deletions, session invalidations, account lockouts, IP address changes, suspicious activity alerts.
    * **Structured Logging:** Use a logging framework that outputs logs in a structured format (e.g., JSON) including timestamps, user UUID (if available), IP address, user agent, event type, and outcome.
    * **Log Retention:** Define a policy for how long logs are stored.
* **Benefit:** Essential for auditing, compliance, troubleshooting, and detecting brute-force attacks or other malicious activities.

#### 6. Enhanced Session Management Features

* **Description:** Leverage your new `sessions` table to implement more sophisticated session controls.
* **Implementation Ideas:**
    * **Idle Session Timeout:** Automatically invalidate sessions in the `sessions` table if `last_accessed_at` hasn't been updated for a configurable period (e.g., 30 minutes). Your `getUser` endpoint would check this.
    * **Absolute Session Timeout:** Even if active, a session should expire after a certain maximum time (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days), regardless of activity. The `expires_at` column is for this.
    * **Concurrent Session Control:** Option to limit the number of active sessions per user (e.g., "only allow 3 simultaneous logins"). If a user tries to log in on a 4th device, invalidate the oldest session.
* **Integration:** Logic primarily in your `UserDao` and your authentication filter/middleware.

By strategically implementing these features, your authentication system will become significantly more secure, user-friendly, and capable of serving the needs of your "other app" in a modern web environment.
